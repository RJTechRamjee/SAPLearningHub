## 📦 Prerequisites

- **Node.js** 18.x or 20.x
- **npm** 8.x or higher
- **SAP CDS CLI** (`@sap/cds-dk`)
- **Cloud Foundry CLI** (for deployment)
- **SAP BTP Account** (for cloud deployment)
- **HANA Cloud Instance** (for production)

## 🚀 Installation

### 1. Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/RJTechRamjee/SAPLearningHub.git
cd SAPLearningHub
```

### 2. Install Dependencies

```bash
# Install root dependencies
npm install

# Install Fiori app dependencies
cd app/listreport && npm install && cd ../..
cd app/treeview && npm install && cd ../..
cd app/analytics && npm install && cd ../..
cd app-router && npm install && cd ..
```

### 3. Install SAP CDS Development Kit (if not already installed)

```bash
npm install -g @sap/cds-dk
```

## 💻 Running Locally

### Start the CAP Server

```bash
cds watch
```

This will:
- Deploy the database schema to SQLite
- Load sample data from CSV files
- Start the OData V4 service at `http://localhost:4004`
- Serve the Fiori launchpad configuration

### Testing the Fiori Applications

**Important**: The Fiori applications in this project are configured for deployment to SAP BTP. For local testing, you have several options:

#### Option 1: Use SAP Fiori Tools (Recommended for Local Development)

Install the SAP Fiori tools extension in VS Code:

```bash
# In VS Code
# 1. Install "SAP Fiori tools - Extension Pack"
# 2. Right-click on any app folder (e.g., app/listreport)
# 3. Select "Preview Application"
# 4. Choose "start fiori run --open 'test/flpSandbox.html'"
```

#### Option 2: Deploy to SAP BTP (Recommended for Full Testing)

The Fiori Launchpad at `http://localhost:4004/app/index.html` requires external UI5 resources and is designed to work when deployed to SAP BTP. For full Fiori Launchpad experience with all three apps:

```bash
mbt build
cf deploy mta_archives/sap-learning-hub_1.0.0.mtar
```

#### Option 3: Test the OData Services Directly

You can test the backend services without the UI:

```bash
# Test Courses Service
curl http://localhost:4004/catalog/Courses

# Test Learning Paths
curl http://localhost:4004/catalog/LearningPaths

# Test Analytics
curl http://localhost:4004/catalog/CourseAnalytics
```

### Access Points

- **OData Service Metadata**: http://localhost:4004/catalog/$metadata
- **OData Service Root**: http://localhost:4004/catalog/
- **Fiori Launchpad Config**: http://localhost:4004/app/index.html (requires BTP deployment for full functionality)
- **Direct App Access**: Available after deployment to BTP

## 🌥 Deployment

### Deploy to SAP BTP Cloud Foundry

#### 1. Build the MTA Archive

```bash
mbt build
```

#### 2. Login to Cloud Foundry

```bash
cf login -a https://api.cf.<region>.hana.ondemand.com
```

#### 3. Deploy the Application

```bash
cf deploy mta_archives/sap-learning-hub_1.0.0.mtar
```

#### 4. Configure Role Collections

After deployment, assign role collections in BTP Cockpit:

## 🔒 Security

### Authentication & Authorization

The application uses **SAP Authorization and Trust Management Service (XSUAA)** for security.

### Roles

1. **Admin** (`SAPLearningHub_Admin`)
   - Full access to all entities
   - Can create, edit, and delete courses
   - Manage categories and learning paths

2. **Instructor** (`SAPLearningHub_Instructor`)
   - Create and edit courses
   - View analytics
   - Read-only access to configuration

3. **Learner** (`SAPLearningHub_Learner`)
   - Browse courses and learning paths
   - View course details
   - Access analytics (read-only)

### Local Development

For local development, authentication is disabled by default. The approuter and XSUAA are only required for cloud deployment.

## 🔧 Troubleshooting

### Fiori Launchpad Navigation Errors

**Issue**: Error message "Failed to resolve navigation target" or "App could not be opened"

**Solution**: This typically occurs when running the Fiori Launchpad locally (`http://localhost:4004/app/index.html`). The launchpad configuration has been updated with proper `crossNavigation` inbounds in each app's `manifest.json` and resolution results in `app/index.html`.

**Fix Applied**:
- ✅ Added `sap.app.crossNavigation.inbounds` to all three app manifests
- ✅ Added `resolutionResult` with component paths to `app/index.html`
- ✅ Configured proper semantic objects and actions

**For Local Testing**:
The Fiori apps in this project are designed for SAP BTP deployment. For local testing:

1. **Use SAP Fiori Tools** in VS Code:
   ```bash
   # Install "SAP Fiori tools - Extension Pack"
   # Right-click on app folder → Preview Application
   ```

2. **Deploy to BTP** for full Fiori Launchpad functionality:
   ```bash
   mbt build
   cf deploy mta_archives/sap-learning-hub_1.0.0.mtar
   ```

3. **Test OData services** directly without UI:
   ```bash
   curl http://localhost:4004/catalog/Courses
   ```

### Missing Dependencies

**Issue**: `cds: command not found`

**Solution**:
```bash
npm install
# OR install globally
npm install -g @sap/cds-dk
```

### Port Already in Use

**Issue**: Server won't start, port 4004 is busy

**Solution**:
```bash
# Find and kill process
lsof -ti:4004 | xargs kill
# OR use different port
cds watch --port 4005
```

## 🛠 Development


### Adding New Data

1. Edit CSV files in `db/data/` folder
2. Follow the existing format (semicolon-separated)
3. Restart the server with `cds watch`

### Modifying Data Model

1. Edit `db/schema.cds`
2. Update service projections in `srv/service.cds`
3. Update UI annotations in `app/*/annotations.cds`
4. Run `cds watch` to redeploy

### Extending Applications

1. Modify annotations in respective `app/*/annotations.cds` files
2. Update manifest.json for routing or configuration changes
3. Use Fiori tools for guided development
